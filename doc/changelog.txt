0.17 (2021-03-06)
=================
Enhancements:
* http: MAPI/HTTP protocol support
* http: Raise max_router_connections & max_rpc_stub_threads limits
  to cope with reconnect storms from midb and zcore.
* doc: manpage for autodiscover
Changes:
* all daemons: Disabled the ip6_container and ip6_filter plugins
  for now; the default settings block too many connections.
Fixes:
* http: fix crash when user_default_lang is unset
* imap: advertise STARTTLS when indeed supported
* all daemons: avoid rejecting IPv6 connections from long addresses


0.16
====
* Configuration that lived in ${datadir} was moved to /etc/gromox:
  cache.txt, exmdb_list.txt, event_acl.txt, fastcgi.txt, midb_acl.txt,
  proxy.txt, rewrite.txt, timer_acl.txt. Their presence is also
  optional now; built-in defaults will be used if absent.
* domain_list.cfg and user_filter.cfg are now optional


0.15
====
* ldap_adaptor: new "ldap_start_tls" config directive to control STARTTLS.
* exchange_nsp: deliver PT_MV_UNICODE properties to clients
* authmgr: new config directive "auth_backend_selection"
* oxcical: escaped commas in values were misparsed, now fixed
  ("TZID:Amsterdam\, Berlin\, etc.")
