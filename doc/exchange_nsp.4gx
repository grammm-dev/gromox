.SH Notes
.PP
A number of properties are always synthesized by exchange_nsp and
never read from any storage; this includes key properties such as
PR_ENTRYID, PR_RECORD_KEY, etc. The following properties need
mentioning:
.IP \(bu 4
PR_DEPARTMENT: This property is synthesized from the department
that a user has been assigned to (cf. SQL table "users", column
"group_id", and SQL table "group", column "title").
.PP
For user-defined properties that are read from SQL (cf. table
"user_properties"), exchange_nsp (as well as zcore(8gx)'s AB) only
handles a subset of property types: PT_BOOLEAN, PT_SHORT, PT_LONG,
PT_I8, PT_SYSTIME, PT_BINARY, PT_UNICODE/STRING8 and
PT_MV_UNICODE/STRING8.
.PP
Multi-valued properties are only supported up to 1 element due to current
limitations in the SQL schema.
