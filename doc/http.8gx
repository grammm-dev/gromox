.SH Synopsis
.PP
\fBhttp\fP [\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\fP]
.SH Description
.PP
http(8gx) is a trivial HTTP server. It understands the special HTTP methods as
used by RPC-over-HTTP protocol as used by Outlook, it can serve files verbatim,
or forward requests to a FastCGI server such as php-fpm(8).
.SH Options
.TP
\fB\-c\fP \fIconfig\fP
Read configuration directives from the given file. If this option is not
specified, /etc/gromox/http.cfg will be read if it exists.
.TP
\fB\-?\fP
Display option summary.
.SH URI processing order
.IP \(bu 4
Requests are passed to the mod_rewrite(4gx) module (built-in) to have their URI
potentially rewritten.
.IP \(bu 4
If a HTTP request is using the methods RPC_IN_DATA or RPC_OUT_DATA, the data
stream is handed off to the exchange_emsmdb(4gx) plugin.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, HPM plugins such as mod_proxy(4gx) are invoked. Processing ends when
one plugin signals that the request was handled. The order depends on the HPM
plugin list (cf. http.cfg(5gx):\fBhpm_plugin_list\fP).
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the mod_fastcgi(4gx) module (built-in) is invoked. Processing ends
if the module handled the request.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the mod_cache(4gx) module (built-in) is invoked. Processing ends
if the module handled the request.
.IP \(bu 4
Otherwise, the request is rejected.
.SH RPC-over-HTTP
.PP
RPC-over-HTTP utilizes two special HTTP methods, RPC_IN_DATA and RPC_OUT_DATA.
These requests can, similarly to HTTP CONNECT, be very long-lived. The RPC data
stream is handled by the included exchange_emsmdb(4gx) plugin.

\fBfastcgi_cache_size\fP
If the HTTP request to a CGI endpoint uses Chunked Transfer Encoding and the

.TP
\fBhost_id\fP
The hostname that the server uses to identify itself (e.g. Server: header in
HTTP responses).
.br
