Gromox is the central groupware server component of grammm. It is capable of
serving as a replacement for Microsoft Exchange and compatibles. Connectivity
options include RPC/HTTP (Outlook Anywhere), MAPI/HTTP, IMAP, POP3, an
SMTP-speaking LDA, and a PHP module with a Z-MAPI function subset.

Gromox relies on other components to provide a sensibly complete mail system,
such as Postfix as a mail transfer agent, and grammm-admin for user management.
A web interface is available with grammm-web. The grammm distribution ships
these essentials and has a ready-to-run installation of Gromox.

Support is available through grammm GmbH and its partners.
See https://grammm.com/ for details.
